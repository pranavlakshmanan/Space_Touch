# Space Touch - Tacto-based Robotics Environment

This is a robotics simulation environment based on the Facebook Research Tacto tactile sensor simulator.

## Features

- Vision-based tactile sensor simulation
- Allegro hand reaching environments
- PyBullet-based physics simulation
- Deep reinforcement learning with stable-baselines3
- Comprehensive logging and analysis tools

## Installation

Use the provided conda environment `st_env` with all required dependencies.

## Usage

Run the test environment:
```bash
python Code_Pranav/RL\ Code/Test_env2.py
```

This will train a PPO agent to perform reaching tasks with the Allegro hand and generate comprehensive logs, TensorBoard data, and analysis plots.
